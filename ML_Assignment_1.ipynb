The test set is important because it provides an unbiased estimate of the model's performance on new data, which is crucial for choosing between different models and for making decisions about whether a model is ready for deployment."

    "The train-dev set (also known as the development set) is a portion of the training data that is used to evaluate the model during the training process. The train-dev set is used to monitor the progress of the model and to detect overfitting. If the performance of the model on the train-dev set starts to degrade while the performance on the training data continues to improve, it indicates that the model is overfitting to the training data and the training process should be stopped. The train-dev set is useful for detecting overfitting early in the training process, which allows for early stopping and prevents wasting time and computational resources on training an overfitted model."

    "Using the test set to tune hyperparameters can lead to overfitting to the test set, which can cause the model to perform well on the test set but poorly on new data. This is because the test set provides a biased estimate of the model's generalization error, as the model has been explicitly tuned to perform well on the test set. Overfitting to the test set can result in an overestimate of the model's performance, which can lead to poor performance on new data and a reduced ability to generalize to unseen situations. It is important to use a validation set for hyperparameter tuning instead of the test set to ensure that the model generalizes well to new data."
